This is a basic portfolio showcasing my top three favorite movies from different genres: fantasy, horror, and crime. Each movie has a short review sharing why itâ€™s a favorite. The portfolio uses headings, paragraphs, and a horizontal line to separate sections, with a clean and straightforward layout.
