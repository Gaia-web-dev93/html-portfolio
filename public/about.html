<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a Security Compliance Specialist by day and a bit of a tech geek by night. With a Master’s in Information Security, I’ve spent years diving deep into the world of keeping data safe. It keeps me on my toes, and I love every bit of the challenge. I’m basically the person who ensures your secrets stay secret in a cool, non-creepy way.</p>

<p>Outside of my day job, I’ve been on a self-taught journey through the world of fullstack web development and Python. It’s like playing with digital Legos. I can build entire websites and make code do my bidding. It’s amazing what you can create when you mix curiosity with a little determination and a lot of coffee.</p>

<p>On the home front, I’m happily married and have two dogs who are basically the bosses of the house. Between work, code, and trying to convince my dogs I’m in charge, my life is a fun mix of chaos and tech. Who needs quiet when you can have coding projects, security protocols, and two dogs chasing squirrels?</p>
