<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>🧝 The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>This movie transports you to a world where elves, hobbits, and wizards feel like old friends. The landscapes are so mesmerizing that you might just want to pack your bags for Middle-earth (if only it existed). The journey is filled with epic battles, heartfelt friendships, and enough twists to keep you glued to the screen. You’ll find yourself cheering for the little guy—literally—and wanting to join the Fellowship on their quest. Seriously, it’s pure cinematic magic.</p>
<h3>👻 The Babadook</h3>
<p>This isn’t your run-of-the-mill horror flick with cheap jump scares. The Babadook creeps under your skin and stays there. It’s part horror, part psychological thriller, and all about confronting your deepest fears. What’s terrifying isn’t just the monster but the way it represents grief, depression, and things we’d rather not talk about. It’s like watching a nightmare unfold, one that you can’t wake up from, and the chilling tension will leave you thinking about it for days—or maybe forever.</p>
<h3>🕵️‍♂️ Seven</h3>
<p>This film takes the crime thriller genre and turns it up to eleven. Seven is dark, twisted, and unsettling in the best way. The killer’s elaborate plan, based on the seven deadly sins, unfolds like a game of cat and mouse where the stakes are nothing less than terrifying. It’s gritty, suspenseful, and each scene pulls you deeper into its web of moral ambiguity. And that ending? Let’s just say, you’ll be questioning everything you thought you knew about good and evil. A crime thriller that truly delivers.</p>
